# Pandemic Predictor Pro

AP Computer Science Principles Summative Project
Developers: Gavin Lim & Jaythaneal Skylar Sutrisno

Detailed Description:
"Pandemic Predictor Pro" is a website-based simulator that allows users to create and run a simulation of a pandemic outbreak. 
The simulator receives input from the user: the number of single-ply and N95 Masks distributed, and the frequency of vaccination Rates within a chosen range of a population. The simulator creates a hypothetical pandemic outbreak that can spread throughout the inputted population. The simulation runs by considering the user's input data and estimating the possible outcomes of the pandemic outbreak. The results of the simulation are the total amount of survivors and deaths. The simulator takes into account different factors that a user inputs to simulate a realistic situation of a pandemic outbreak, and to give an approximate estimate of the outcomes of the pandemic. 

Extra Details:
1. The Single Ply and N95 Masks Distributed are essential to the simulation because they represent the accessibility to protection for the population. The amount of masks distributed affects the rate at which individuals can avoid contracting the disease, which means that if more people are protected, the risk of spread of the infection decreases.

2. Vaccination rates are also crucial in the simulation as they determine the percentage of the population that is considered immune to the disease, which can significantly impact the spread of the virus. The higher the vaccination rate, the less likely the pandemic will spread.
